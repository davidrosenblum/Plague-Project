# Plague Project - React UI

### Installation & Setup

__Install required modules__

```npm i``` 

__Install required GLOBAL modules (required for CLI)__

(react scripts is bigger and takes longer to install) 

```npm i -g react-scripts``` 

### Development Server



Starts the dev server, auto updates when you change things!

```npm start```

(must be done in same folder as package.json)

This auto opens your web browser

```http://localhost:3000``` to access React App (default settings)

### Building Production App

Essentially "compiles" the React app into real HTML/JS

```npm run build```

(must be done in same folder as package.json)
